# Introduction:
We were set a task to develop an application with a Natural User Interface. 
There was a lot of options that we could have picked, for example, myoband, voice recognition etc.
I wanted to challenge myself with this project and decided to create a VR game using the Unity game engine. 
I purchased a VR headset not long before the project and I wanted to test it out. I have a document explaining the VR game fruit ninja. 
The document will be split to different parts each explaining something different within the project.
